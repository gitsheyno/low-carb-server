    "description": "You won’t feel dirty, but you might feel a little ‘naughty’ after biting into one of these dirty chai cheesecake truffles. Yes, they are Keto! Cream cheese truffles are flavored with coffee brewed with chai tea. The infused coffee flavors the whole truffle and is wrapped in a coating of Keto dark chocolate. To get a result like you see in this recipe, you’ll need to use non-dairy, sugar-free 100% dark chocolate chips. You’ll most likely find this product where other special dietary foods are shelved at your grocery store. If you can’t find this type of chocolate, look for unsweetened 100% dark chocolate in the baking aisle. Keep the truffles in your freezer or your refrigerator - your choice. Enjoy them as a dessert or whenever you need a sweet fat bomb to get you through the afternoon.\n\n### Truffle Toppings\n\nTypically, the truffles you see in shops and bakeries are decorated with a topping that reflects the flavors inside the truffle. For this dirty chai cheesecake truffle, you could choose a spice that complements the chai flavors, such as a pinch of cinnamon or cardamom. Since there is coffee in the truffle, a single coffee bean is a Keto-friendly decoration that can go on top. If you don’t want to add anything to the truffles, use a toothpick to swirl a little design in the wet chocolate before it sets.\n\n### What Are The White Dots On My Chocolate?\n\nAssuming you are not a seasoned pastry chef or baker, it’s possible your truffles may show some white specs or streaks within the chocolate coating after they set. Don’t be alarmed! These are the fats or oils separating from the liquid part that makes chocolate. Your chocolate has not gone bad, and it won’t taste any different. This separation is what naturally happens when chocolate goes through temperature changes.\n\nJessica L.",

      "You’ll need to brew coffee before you can make the truffle filling. Brew a full cup of coffee, and set 1 bag of chai tea per cup to steep for 5 minutes. After steeping, discard the teabag and set the coffee aside to cool. While you will only need a small amount of your chai coffee, you’ll have to make enough to steep the teabag reasonably. You can choose to discard any remaining coffee or utilize the remainder at the end of the recipe.",
      "To make the truffle filling, blend cream cheese in a stand mixer until the cream cheese is soft and spreadable. You can leave the cream cheese out at room temperature for 15-20 minutes prior to making the recipe so it is softened. Once the cream cheese is aerated, add butter cut into pieces. Continue mixing until both the butter and cream cheese are blended together free of lumps. Mix in Swerve, salt, vanilla extract, and the listed amount of coffee until blended.",
      "Transfer the truffle filling to a smaller container, cover it, and set it in your freezer to chill. Chill the truffle filling for a minimum of 2 hours until the filling is thick enough to scoop like ice cream. This may take up to 4 or more hours, depending on your freezer and how much you’re making. When the filling is firm enough, line a sheet tray with parchment paper. Scoop 1 ½ TB of filling and roll it into a ball between your palms. Repeat until all the truffles are formed.",
      "Set the tray of truffles back in your freezer to chill overnight. Now, you want them completely frozen - 8 hours or more. The next day, you’ll need to prepare the chocolate for dipping. Create a double boiler by placing a heat-safe bowl over a pot filled with 1 inch of water. Heat the double boiler until the water is simmering but not creating rising steam. Place the chocolate chips in the bowl, and continually stir the chocolate until it melts.",
      "Remove the bowl of chocolate off the heat, leaving the pot behind. Set the hot bowl on a potholder or cloth, and stir the chocolate as it cools. Continue stirring until the chocolate thickens for dipping. Pull your tray of truffles out of the freezer. One by one, use a fork to dip a frozen truffle in the chocolate, let excess chocolate drip off, and return the truffle to the parchment paper.",
      "Repeat the dipping process until all the truffles are complete. At your discretion, you can choose to add decoration or Keto topping to the truffle. The truffles photographed here are topped with an extra drizzled design of dark chocolate. Return your tray of truffles to the freezer one final time to set for 30 minutes. After setting, you can keep the truffles in the freezer for a cold treat or store them in the refrigerator for a softer, chilled truffle. The truffles will always be best stored in the refrigerator and should not be left out at room temperature."

    "description": "Who says you can’t eat muffins on a Keto diet? In fact, you can make healthy Keto blueberry muffins every week if you want to! These muffins are a classic recipe and easy to follow. Only a few ingredient tweaks have been made to make a more Keto-friendly muffin. Don’t worry, you CAN eat berries on the Keto diet. A few tucked into a soft muffin is a genius way to enjoy some fruit without having too many carbs. Eat a muffin for breakfast, as a snack, or as a side with your lunch. They’re easy to wrap up and take with you to work or serve a fresh batch on a Sunday morning.\n\n**Make the muffins healthier**\n\nWant to make the muffins friendlier for all to eat? Choose alternative milk. You can replace almond milk with oat milk and even replace the almond flour with coconut flour for anyone with tree nut allergies.\n\n**Tips for using blueberries**\n\nBlueberries are notorious for bursting and bleeding in batter while you mix them in. Here’s a tip: freeze your blueberries before you use them in the recipe. You can even dust frozen blueberries in almond flour before mixing them in to help the blueberries stay in place in the muffin batter while the muffins bake.\n\n**Storage tips**\n\nWait for the muffins to cool entirely before sealing them in a Ziploc bag. You can also wrap the muffins individually in plastic wrap. Muffins are great for taking on the go for breakfast or a snack, so keep them in your refrigerator for the most freshness for up to 5 days.",

    "description": "This vegan Keto dessert recipe is quick and easy to prepare and requires only 5 ingredients. Our simple low carb dessert is made with chilled coconut cream, powdered erythritol, fresh lemon juice, juicy strawberries, and raspberries. This makes a great vegan Keto treat, perfect for summer dining.\n\n### Can I Use Coconut Milk?\n\nWe have used chilled coconut cream for our vegan-friendly Keto syllabub. Coconut cream is the thick cream that forms at the top of a can of coconut milk. It makes a great plant-based alternative to heavy cream and can be whipped to create a smooth and fluffy consistency. You can buy coconut cream on its own, or if this is difficult to find, you can refrigerate a can of coconut milk, and once solid, simply scoop the firm cream from the top of the can. It is important to chill the coconut cream to allow it to be firm enough to whip. You do not want to use the liquid part of the coconut milk - this can be reserved for a separate recipe or smoothie.\n\n### Can I Use a Different Sweetener?\n\nWe have used powdered erythritol for our vegan Keto dessert recipe. Powdered sweetener blends well with coconut cream to create a smooth dessert consistency. You may use any powdered low carb sweetener you prefer or even stevia drops if desired, adjusting quantities to taste. Please be sure to adjust your macros to account for any changes made to the original recipe.",

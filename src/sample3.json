    "description": "This Keto crustless pizza is prepared without a flour based base, is fuss free and is made in one skillet. This is a great low carb pizza alternative the whole family can enjoy. Perfect for a quick and easy Keto dinner with minimal prep and washing up!\n\n### Keto Crustless Pizza Ingredients\n\nOur easy Keto crustless pizza is prepared with a simple base layer of melted and cooled cheddar cheese. Once the base layer is set, it is topped with passata, oozy mozzarella, salami, black olives and aromatic oregano. The pizza is then oven baked until hot and bubbling, then left to cool and firm before serving with a scattering of fresh basil.\n\n### Serving Suggestions\n\nThis crustless Keto pizza is heavy with cheese so is complemented perfectly by a simple garden salad. Alternatively you could serve with some low carb steamed veggies. This recipe makes one large pizza which serves two people.",

      "Add the coconut flour, ground flaxseed, 1 tablespoon of the erythritol, cinnamon, xanthan gum, coconut oil, salt and 1 tablespoon of cream cheese to a food processor. Crack the egg into the food processor. Blend to combine, then add the water and blend again until a pliable dough forms in the food processor. You may use an alternative low carb sweetener as desired, just be sure to adjust your macros accordingly.",
      "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit and line a shallow oven tray with baking paper. Turn the dough out onto the lined oven tray. Press or roll the dough into a circle, roughly 1/4 inch thick. Transfer the tray to the oven and bake for 15 minutes or until cooked through and lightly golden brown all over.",
      "Whilst the pizza base is baking, you can prepare the frosting layer. Add the remaining cream cheese, butter, remaining erythritol and vanilla to a food processor. Blend together until smooth and well combined. Taste and add a little more sweetener if desired.",
      "Remove the cooked pizza base from the oven. Set to one side to cool completely. The base needs to be completely cooled so that it does not melt the frosting. Spoon the frosting onto the pizza base. Use a spatula to spread the frosting evenly over the base.",
      "Slice the strawberries into quarters and the raspberries in half. Arrange the sliced strawberries and raspberries randomly over the frosting. Scatter the blueberries over the top of the pizza. Slice into quarters to serve."

    "description": "These little rolls are a delicious cross between a cheesy breadstick and garlic knot. When warm and hot out of the oven, the rolls have such a great texture and spring, just like real bread! The cheesy dough is stuffed with marinara sauce and baked, so  all of the pizza goodness is tucked in one little roll. Feel free to dip them into your favorite sauce as well! Note that coconut milk was used in making the dough, but you can use regular dairy as well!",
